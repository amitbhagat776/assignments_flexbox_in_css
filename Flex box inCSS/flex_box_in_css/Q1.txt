CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid are two different layout systems in CSS, 
each with its own purpose and capabilities.

CSS Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout):
Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layout, primarily for distributing space along a single axis, either horizontally or vertically.
Flexbox is particularly useful for building navigation menus, sidebars, and other components where you need items to adapt to varying content or viewport sizes.
It is well-suited for creating flexible and responsive layouts, such as aligning items within a container or distributing space evenly among multiple items.


Example:

.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}

.item {
  flex: 1;
}


CSS Grid (Grid Layout):
Grid layout is designed for two-dimensional layout, allowing you to define both rows and columns to create grid-like structures.
Grid is ideal for aligning and positioning items in a grid-like fashion and controlling the placement of elements within both rows and columns.
It is excellent for creating complex, grid-based designs, such as web page layouts with rows and columns where items can span multiple cells.


for example:
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  grid-gap: 10px;
}

.item {
  grid-column: span 1;
  grid-row: span 2;
}
